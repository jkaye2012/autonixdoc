# Features to add

- [x] Add a "loader" abstraction that could be used in place of the existing "autoloader"
  - For example, a "configuration mapped" loader could allow the user to map specific source files
    to corresponding destination files rather than performing the mapping fully automatically
- [ ] Implement the CLI interface and driver
- [ ] Implement the configuration-mapped loader
- [ ] Flag for the optional creation of an `index.md` file; this would have some loader- specific
      interaction that should be considered
- [ ] Initial documentation
  - [ ] Quickstart
  - [ ] How-to guides
  - [ ] Explanation
  - [ ] Reference docs
